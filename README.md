# 1. Overview

> **TL;DR:** Happy Storage is a POC application for educational purposes.

### A) HappyStorage.Core
The core of the application was forked from [GitHub/dlinkous](https://github.com/dlinkous/trinug-pluginarchitecture)

The user story is as a manager of a self-store business I want to be able to allow *customers* to reserve *units* on a month to month basis to store their ~~junk~~ stuff in. 
 - Customers can be added and deleted.
 - Customers can occupy zero or many units
 - Customers that have occupied a unit for a month incur a cost of the unit's monthly cost.
 - Payments can be accepted from a customer and that amount is applied to their total owed amount.
 - Units can be created and decommissioned. 
 - A user must be able to search for available units (not occupied by a customer) and filter that list by **X** criteria.
 - Units can be reserved by a customer. Once the unit is occupied it is no longer available to be reserved.
 - Units can be released from being occupied by a customer, and it is again available.
 
 You get the idea..
 
 The educational concept behind the core project is the 
'Plugin', 'Hexagonal' or 'Onion' Architectures.  Personally, I like onions because like onions, ogres have layers.

### B) Additions
Added to the project are:
 - `HappyStorage.Web` which is an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application
 - `HappyStorage.BlazorWeb` which is an ASP.NET Core Server Side Blazor Application
 - `HappyStorage.Common.Ui` is the shared code for both UI projects

# 2. Running Locally

### A) Prerequisites
If you want to run the Blazor Project locally, you will need:
 - .NET Core SDK 3.0.0 Preview 5 -> [Link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)
 - Visual Studio 2019 Preview 1
 - I have not tested with Visual Studio 2019, but it may work if you enable "Use Preview Versions"

Otherwise, the latest .NET Core 2.2 and Visual Studio 2017 will work for the rest of the projects.

### B) SQL Database
1. Create an SQL Database; ex: "HappyStorage"
1. Run the SQL script located in the `HappyStorage/SqlScripts/` folder to create the table required to persist units.
1. If not using `(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB` ensure you update the connection string in your `appsettings.Development.json` for both the `*.Web` and `*.BlazorWeb` project.

```
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SqlUnitStore": "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=HappyStorage;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False;ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;MultiSubnetFailover=False"
  }
```
